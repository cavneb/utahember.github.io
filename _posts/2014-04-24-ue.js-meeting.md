Tonight we had 2 full presentations followed by some lighting talks. Instructure sponsored the event by providing food, the space, and media equipment for recordings.

[Daniel]() did a deep dive into Ember Promises/RSVP.

[Brett Valantine](https://github.com/brettv) took us on an iterative walkthrough on adding support for Twitter Bootstrap modals in our Ember apps.

The videos should be added after the fact, but as always, being present is better. You can't eat the digital pizza or ask questions of the video. :)
